Hackday 2013 - MOO.COM project 

Task: Implement Friday lunch app that will allow Rachel (now Sophie) to manage all lunches and requests

This should allow any member of the staff to enter their lunch request and also a list of pas lunches where they'll be able to rate them with 5 stars and a comment.

The app should allow export of all names and requests in a print-friendly format.

The app is using Laravel for the back-end and AngularJS + Bootstrap for the front-end.
